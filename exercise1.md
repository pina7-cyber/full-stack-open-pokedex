For the hypothetical situation mentioned above, I assume that the application is written in Python. The Python ecosystem has a wide range of tools and libraries that can be used for Continuous Integration (CI) processes.

For linting, a popular tool in the Python community is Flake8. It combines several linting tools into one package and can be easily integrated into a CI pipeline. Other options include Pylint, Black, and Bandit.

For testing, Python has a built-in testing framework called unittest. However, there are many other testing frameworks available, such as pytest and nose. These frameworks provide additional features and flexibility to write and execute tests.

For building, Python doesn't require any compilation since it's an interpreted language. However, building the application can include packaging the application into a distribution format, such as a wheel or a tarball. Python has a built-in module called setuptools, which can be used for packaging the application.

When it comes to choosing a CI tool, there are many alternatives to Jenkins and GitHub Actions. Some popular cloud-based CI tools are Travis CI, CircleCI, and GitLab CI/CD. Self-hosted alternatives include Drone, TeamCity, and Buildbot.

The decision of whether to use a self-hosted or cloud-based CI environment depends on various factors. Self-hosted environments give more control and customizability over the CI pipeline, but they require more maintenance and resources. Cloud-based CI environments are easier to set up and require less maintenance, but they may have limitations on customization and security.

To make an informed decision, factors such as the team's technical expertise, budget, and security requirements should be considered. Additionally, the size of the project and the frequency of code changes should also be taken into account, as they can affect the cost and maintenance of the CI pipeline.
